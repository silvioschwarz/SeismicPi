Disclaimer:
This project was first brought to life during the course Digitalseismologie at University Potsdam in 2013. It may have some strong resemblances with [raspberry shake]( https://raspberryshake.org/) which is unintentional. 
I am merely one nerdy guy :neckbeard: doing diy stuff as a hobby and the raspberry shakers are a team with expertise in seismological device development for 10+ years.
Still, I am by magnitudes more affordable :smirk:
