Disclaimer:
This project was first brought to live during the course Digitalseismologie at University Potsdam n 2013. It may have some strong resemblances with raspberry shake by GEMPA which is unintentional. 
I am merely one nerdy guy doing diy stuff as a hobby and GEMPA is a team of experts.
Also by examining closer there are some crucial differences. The only thing n common is the Raspberry Pi as a Platform, really.
My goal is a truly open-source ecosystem, hackable in every aspect and I have no intentions of commercializing or at least turning the financial gain to 11. It would be a huge success if this project can finance itself.
Meanwhile, I am doing this just for fun (hereafter refered to as "shits and giggles" and the intellectual competition.).
Another core philosophy is automation, machine learning and heuristics. In the framework of seismic hazard this can not be stressd enough and  ... I am bamboozeled that till this day many senior professionals shy away from probabilities let alone ... BAYESIAN statistics.
This project features probability center stage!
