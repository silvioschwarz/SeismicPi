abstract = {The attenuation of seismic intensity with distance in Italy is analyzed by using felt intensity report data obtained from two comprehensive historical databases recently made available. The observed attenuation pattern that in the past was interpreted as a logarithmic or root (square or cubic) attenuation law shows quite clearly two different linear trends in the near and in the far field. At distances shorter than 45 km, the decrease of the intensity with distance is about one degree per 20 km, while at longer distances the slope is about one degree per 50 km. This is in agreement with some recent findings of realistic modeling of seismic ground motion that has been explained as the transition from upper-crust direct Sg phases to waves reflected at the Moho controlling the energy main release. The slope of the curve in the far field shows a regional dependence in agreement with recent works on the attenuation of Pn and Sn phases in Italy. If effective, this correlation might allow us to discriminate the contribution of crustal and subcrustal paths in seismic intensity attenuation studies. },

abstract = {A new relationship between modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) and peak ground velocity (PGV) is developed by comparing instrumentally recorded and inferred historical PGV values to observed MMI for 18 significant earthquakes from eastern North America (ENA), of moment magnitude 3.6-7.25. This PGV-MMI relationship is implemented in ShakeMaps in Ontario to estimate ground-shaking intensity (instrumentally derived MMI), given instrumental recordings of PGV. Corresponding relationships for 5\% damped pseudoacceleration (PSA) at frequencies of 1, 5, and 10 Hz are also developed. We compare the results with previous relationships between MMI and ground motion parameters developed for California by Wald et al. (1999a) and Atkinson and Sonley (2000). We conclude that empirical relationships between MMI and ground motion are significantly different in eastern North America than in California. Thus, such relationships should be assessed for each region where ShakeMaps are implemented. },

abstract = {A new approach is proposed for the empirical validation of intensity attenuation relationships to be implemented in standard procedure devoted to probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (psha). To this purpose, the overall number of documented intensities above a given threshold in the area of interest is compared with the one expected on the basis of the considered attenuation relationship. By using this methodology, the reliability of empirical relationships can be analyzed by also taking into account the uncertainty affecting ill-defined intensity attributions both at the epicenter and at the site. To assess the feasibility of this procedure, an attenuation relationship recently proposed for the Italian region has been evaluated by considering felt intensities documented in the area during the past two centuries. Although the macroseismic database considered for validation is the same used for the parameterization of the investigated relationship, important discrepancies have been detected between observed and computed intensities in the range of values significant for seismic hazard. This result indicates that a careful parameterization of attenuation relationships in their complete probabilistic form is mandatory when such relationships have to be implemented in psha procedures. },

abstract = {Comparison of generative and discriminative classifiers is an ever-lasting topic. As an important contribution to this topic, based on their theoretical and empirical comparisons between the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression, Ng and Jordan (NIPS 841-848, 2001) claimed that there exist two distinct regimes of performance between the generative and discriminative classifiers with regard to the training-set size. In this paper, our empirical and simulation studies, as a complement of their work, however, suggest that the existence of the two distinct regimes may not be so reliable. In addition, for real world datasets, so far there is no theoretically correct, general criterion for choosing between the discriminative and the generative approaches to classification of an observation x into a class y; the choice depends on the relative confidence we have in the correctness of the specification of either p(y vertical bar x) or p(x, y) for the data. This can be to some extent a demonstration of why Efron (J Am Stat Assoc 70(352):892-898, 1975) and O'Neill (J Am Stat Assoc 75(369):154-160, 1980) prefer normal-based linear discriminant analysis (LDA) when no model mis-specification occurs but other empirical studies may prefer linear logistic regression instead. Furthermore, we suggest that pairing of either LDA assuming a common diagonal covariance matrix (LDA-A) or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression may not be perfect, and hence it may not be reliable for any claim that was derived from the comparison between LDA-A or the naive Bayes classifier and linear logistic regression to be generalised to all generative and discriminative classifiers.},

abstract = {Results of probabilistic seismic hazard assessment (PSHA), in terms of macroseismic intensity applied to the Mt. Etna region, are presented. PSHA has been performed using a numencal procedure based on the extensive use of local macroseismic infonnation, as an altemative to the usual Comell-McGuire methods. The large amount of intensity data available for this area - coming from the Italian intensity database DBMI04 for the regional earthquakes, and from the Etna catalogue for the 'local' events - has provided fairly exhaustive seismic site histories (i.e. the data set of macroseismic observations available for a given locality) to estimate the seismic hazard for 402 localities on the volcano. In order to improve the completeness of the site catalogue when historical information is missing, observed intensity data have been iritegrated with values calculated from epicentral information obtained by using an attenuation law specific for the Etna region. Using a probability distribution considering the completeness of the input database and the uncertainty of intensity data, the hazard in terms of maximum intensity (I,P) characterised by a 10\% probability of exceeclance in an exposure time of 50 years, has been computed. The highest values I-exp = IX or X) are found in the south-eastem flank of Mt. Etna while the rest of the volcano is exposed to a lower hazard (I-exp = VIII). Despite the low energy (M 4.8) compared with that of the large regional earthquakes affecting the area (6.6 M 7.4), the local events strongly influence the pattem of the hazard in the eastem sector of Mt. Etna, representing a significant, and sole, source of hazard when a shorter exposure time (e.g. 30 years) is considered.},

abstract = {Several different attenuation models have recently been proposed for the Italian region to characterize the decay of macroseismic intensity with the distance from the source. The significant scatter between these relationships and some significant drawbacks that seem to characterize previous approaches (described in a companion article by Pasolini et al., 2008) suggest that the problem needs to be reconsidered. As a first step toward more detailed analyses in the future, this study aimed at developing an isotropic attenuation relationship for the Italian area. Because this attenuation relationship has to be used primarily in probabilistic seismic hazard assessment, major attention was given to evaluating the attenuation relationship in its complete probabilistic form. Another important aspect of this study was the preliminary evaluation of the intrinsic (i.e., independent of the specific attenuation relationship to be used) scattering of data, which represents the lowest threshold for the residual variance that cannot be explained by the attenuation relationship. Furthermore, the peculiar formal features of intensity data and relevant uncertainties were considered carefully. To reduce possible biases, the completeness of the available database was checked and a suitable data selection procedure was applied. Since epicentral intensity cannot be defined unambiguously from the experimental point of view, the attenuation relationship was scaled with a new variable that is more representative of the earthquake dimension. Several criteria were considered when evaluating competing attenuation formulas (explained variance, Bayesian information criteria, Akaike information criteria, etc.). Statistical uncertainty about empirical parameters was evaluated by using standard approaches and bootstrap simulations. The performance of the selected relationship with respect to a control sample was analyzed by using a distribution-free approach. The resulting equation for the expected intensity I at a site located at epicentral distance R is where , h=(3.91±0.27) km, and IE is the average expected intensity at the epicenter for a given earthquake that can be computed from the intensity data (when available) or by using empirical relationships with the moment magnitude Mw or the epicentral intensity I0 reported by the Italian seismic catalog Comparison of the model standard deviation (S.D.) (0.69 intensity degrees) with the intrinsic one (0.62) indicates that this attenuation equation is not far from being optimal. },

abstract = {In this paper, we apply a probabilistic procedure to model the attenuation of the macroseismic intensity in the Mt. Etna region, which allows estimating probabilistic seismic scenarios. Starting from the local earthquake catalogue, we select a dataset of 47 events having epicentral intensity I0 from VI to IX-X EMS, and update the model parameters previously achieved for Italy according to the Bayesian paradigm. For each class of epicentral intensity I0, we then estimate the probability distribution of the intensity at a site conditioned on the epicentre-site distance through a binomial-beta model, under the assumption of a point seismic source and isotropic decay (circular). The mode of the distribution is taken as the expected intensity Is at that site. Since the strongest earthquakes show a preferential propagation of shaking along the fault strike and a rapid decrease in the perpendicular direction, we also consider the anisotropic decay (elliptical) of the intensity due to a linear source (finite fault). We therefore transform the plane so that the ellipse has the length of the fault rupture as maximum axis and its strike as azimuth is changed into a circle with fixed diameter; then we apply the probabilistic model obtained for the isotropic case to the modified data. The entire calculation procedure is implemented in the software PROSCEN which, given the location and the epicentral intensity (and eventually the fault parameters) of the earthquake to be simulated, generates the probabilistic seismic scenario according to the isotropic and anisotropic models of attenuation. The results can be plotted on grid maps representing (1) the intensity that can be exceeded with a fixed probability, or (2) the probability of exceeding a fixed intensity value. The first representation may also find application in seismic monitoring at Etna volcano, in order to produce real-time intensity ShakeMaps based on the instrumental parameters calculated by the automatic earthquake processing system. © 2012.},

Moreover a validation procedure was developed to measure the capability of intensity decay relationships to reproduce the observed intensities. A case study of 55 earthquakes, divided into 9 subsets, of similar-attenuation zones, was analysed, using, as attenuation law, the one proposed by Grandori (1987, l991) to estimate either the parameters for each single earthquake or the parameters of an average intensity decay relationship for the similar-attenuation zones. The calculated intensity decay relationships result in 60- 70\% of correctly reproduced points for most intensity data maps analysed. Analysing the similar-attenuation zones and different earthquakes simultaneously, the parameters of attenuation laws obtain results with a lower percentage of correctly reproduced points. The proposed methodology seems to be effective and suitable to reach practical results in parameters estimation of intensity decay relationships.},

abstract = {The analysis of the seismic attenuation is a prominent and problematic component of hazard assessment. Over the last decade it has become increasingly clear that the intrinsic uncertainty of the decay process must be expressed in probabilistic terms. This implies estimating the probability distribution of the intensity at a site Is as the combination of the distribution of the decay\{Delta\} I and of the distribution of the intensity I0 found for the area surrounding that site. We focus here on the estimation of the distribution of\{Delta\} I. Previous studies presented in the literature show that the intensity decay in Italian territory varies greatly from one region to another and depends on many factors, some of them not easily measurable. Assuming that the decay shows a similar behavior in function of the epicenter-site distance when the same geophysical conditions and building vulnerability characterize different macroseismic fields, we have classified some macroseismic fields drawn from the Italian felt report database by applying a clustering algorithm. Earthquakes in the same class constitute the input of a two-step procedure for the Bayesian estimation of the probability distribution of\{Delta\} I at any distance from the epicenter, conditioned on I0, where\{Delta\} I is considered an integer, random variable, following a binomial distribution. The scenario generated by a future earthquake is forecast either by the predictive distribution in each distance bin or by a binomial distribution whose parameter is a continuous function of the distance. The estimated distributions have been applied to forecast the scenario actually produced by the Colfiorito earthquake on 26 September 1997; for both options the e xpected and observed intensities have been compared on the basis of some validation criteria. The same procedure has been repeated using the probability distribution of\{Delta\} I estimated on the basis of each class of macroseismic fields identified by the clustering algorithm.},

abstract = {In this study, we applied a probabilistic methodology to seismic hazard assessment in metropolitan France. For that purpose we determined an attenuation law adapted to the French context. This law holds for peak ground acceleration on stiff bedrock for earthquakes with local magnitudes between 2.5 and 5.6 recorded in near field (at distances between 3 and 50 km). Geological conditions are taken into account by means of a three-categories classification of lithologies based on a 1/1,000,000 geological map. The seismotectonic zonation consists of areas of diffuse seismicity characterized by a frequency-magnitude distribution. In southeastern France, active faults are considered in a test case and are assumed to follow the characteristic earthquake model. We performed hazard curves for six French cities and maps of peak horizontal ground accelerations expected for return periods of 475, 975, and 1975 years in the country. Sensitivity tests have been performed. The uncertainty introduced by ground-motion variability seems minor compared with that due to the choice of the attenuation law. This study points to the importance of testing internal consistency of the various data and laws used in any seismic hazard analysis (in particular, here the type of magnitude used to predict ground motion). If not, some systematic bias is introduced that may result in systematic errors on peak ground acceleration determination. We also show that the introduction of possibly very large and infrequent events, known only from paleoseismic investigations, may have a dramatic impact on the hazard, especially when long periods of time are considered.},

@article{Musson2005,
abstract = {Intensity attenuation is relatively little studied compared with the attenuation of peak ground acceleration, due to the fact that the PGA can be used for engineering design, while intensity cannot. However, intensity has other uses, including the estimation of effects (including damage) of future earthquakes, and hence, at least in a general way, the study of earthquake risk. Knowledge of intensity attenuation is also useful in calibrating hazard models against historical experience. In this study, the attenuation of intensity in the U.K. is thoroughly evaluated from a data set comprising 727 isoseismals from 326 British earthquakes, including both modern and historical events. Best results are obtained by restricting the data set to events contributing at least two isoseismals. The preferred equation is \$ I = 3.31 + 1.28\{\backslash rm ML\} - 1.22\backslash ln\backslash!R \$I=331+128ML−122lnR where I is intensity (European Macroseismic Scale), ML is local magnitude, and R is hypocentral distance. The sigma (uncertainty) value is 0.46. Some sample applications of this formula are demonstrated.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a method for the evaluation of the seismic risk at the site of an engineering project. The results are in terms of a ground motion parameter (such as peak acceleration) versus average return period. The method incorporates the influence of all potential sources of earthquakes and the average activity rates assigned to them. Arbitrary geographical relationships between the site and po- tential point, line, or areal sources can be modeled with computational ease. In the range of interest, the derived distributions of maximum annual ground motions are in the form of Type I or Type II extreme value distributions, if the more com- monly assumed magnitude distribution and attenuation laws are used.},

@article{Michelini2008,
abstract = {Since 2005, the Italian Civil Protection (Dipartimento della Protezione Cilvile, DPC) has funded several projects driven toward fast assessment of ground motion shaking in Italy - the final goal being that of organizing the emergency and direct the search and rescue (SAR) teams. To this end, the Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV) has started to determine shakemaps using the USGS-ShakeMap¨ package within 30 minutes from event occurrence and adopting a manually revised location. In this paper we present the INGV implementation of USGS-ShakeMap¨ for earthquakes occurring in Italy and immediately neighboring areas. Emphasis is put on data acquisition, the adopted ground motion predictive relations and the site corrections for the local amplifications of the ground motion. Finally, two examples of shakemaps are shown - the first determined for a recent medium size earthquake, the other for the large Irpinia, 1980, M6.9 event. For both events, the maps are compared to the available macroseismic data.},
